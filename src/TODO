This is a random list of potential improvements:
- support more feature types: proteins, protein domains/motifs, markers, QTLs etc.
- add GFF phase info to CDS (mandatory) but can't find a corresponding ontology term
- add GFF source info (SO does not have relevant property for this)
- add description of data resource (GFF file)
- link the chromosomal regions to genome browser tracks
- support named RDF graphs (JSON-LD, TriG, N-Quads)
- provide external links to primary and derived molecular databases (e.g. ENA, UniProt, Ensembl, InterPro, GO, OMA, NCBI's GenBank, Refseq and Gene)
- add provenance information (e.g. versioning of genome builds and annotations) using PROV-O, PAV, VoID, DCAT and/or NanoPub
- resolvable SGN URIs for all genome features
- make the SGN resource available as Linked Open Data
- add ontology mappings to configuration file
- add logging
- optimize memory use (currently in-memory graph store)
