This is a random list of potential improvements:
- support more features: proteins, protein domains/motifs, chromosomes etc.
- support named RDF graphs (JSON-LD, TriG, N-Quads)
- provide external links to primary and derived molecular databases (e.g. ENA, UniProt, InterPro, GO, NCBI's GenBank, Refseq and Gene)
- add provenance information (e.g. versioning of genome builds and annotations) using PROV-O, PAV, VoID, DCAT and/or NanoPub
- resolvable SGN URIs for all genome features
- make the SGN resource available as Linked Open Data
